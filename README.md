## Overview

### The challenge

Through this challenge, I practiced:
- creating a minimal layout using both Flexbox and CSS Grid
- alternating sections with fade-in animation using intersection observer
- creating a sticky header on scroll-up

From the analysis to the deployment of the project, it took me approximately 6 hours.
- analysis, header, footer : 2h40
- main: 2h20
- intersection observer, sticky header, deployment: 1h

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [react-intersection-observer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-intersection-observer)
- [Material Icons](https://mui.com/material-ui/material-icons/)

### Continued development

- I can improve this project by adding smoother fade-in transition for the logos banner.
- I can improve this project by adding dark/light mode options.
